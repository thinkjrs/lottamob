# My Talk at the Chapman Symposium on Special Jurisdictions

Made available [here](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=585519851784525) at the Facebook page of the Institute for Competitive Governance.

From the symposium description:  

"Countries across the world have sought to encourage growth by creating Special Economic Zones (SEZs) that operate under different rules from the surrounding area. In the United States, these take the form of Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs)--secure areas located in or near its ports of entry, such as harbors or airports, but outside of its customs or duties territory, legally speaking. Despite the growing popularity of such zones, however, and their unusual features, they have largely escaped the attention of legal scholars.

How do SEZs fit within conventional models of state authority? Does the extra-territorial status of U.S. FTZs, and their special tax statute, raise constitutional issues? Should the United States reconsider the growing popularity of FTZs or leverage their success to create new and even more comprehensive special jurisdictions?"
