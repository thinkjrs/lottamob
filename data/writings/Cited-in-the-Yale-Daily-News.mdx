# Cited in the Yale Daily News
 
Cited in [this article](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2018/04/26/federal-program-will-lower-capital-gains-taxes/) in the Yale Daily News on Connecticut's coming “opportunity zones”. My comments were clearly messed up in the first, very long, sentence, but I am sharing for good measure. 

"Lotta Moberg, macroeconomic analyst at William Blair, a financial services firm, said that while the program may divert investments from more promising areas into more distressed neighborhoods, which tend to have a lower development potential, it is nevertheless similar to other redistributive policies that trade net outcome for more equity. One major pitfall, she warned, is that governments often make mistaken judgements in evaluating the need and potentials of different areas in a free market, dampening the program’s efficacy."
