# Tyler Cowen at Marginal Revolution blogs on my book

Blog link [here](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/03/political-economy-special-economic-zones-lotta-moberg.html).
This is Tyler Cowen’s own blurb for the book:"‘What do Special Economic Zones actually accomplish? And what are there drawbacks and limitations? Lotta Moberg’s The Political Economy of Special Economic Zones mixes theory and empirics to offer the very best available answers to these questions.’ ― Tyler Cowen, Professor of Economics, George Mason University, USA"

My favorite comment to the post: "Is Lotta Moberg a real name?"
