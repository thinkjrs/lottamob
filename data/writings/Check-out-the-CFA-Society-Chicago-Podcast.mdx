# Check out the CFA Society Chicago Podcast

As co-chain of the Education Advisory Group since September 2020, I have had the priviledge to be deeply involved with growting our podcast. It has become a high-quality source of information and inspiration though engaging conversations with interesting people.

You find all episodes on our podcast channel [here](https://www.cfachicago.org/podcasts/) or in your favorite podcast app.
