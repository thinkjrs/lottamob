# Don Boudreaux Blogs About My Book at Cafe Hayek

Blog post [here](https://cafehayek.com/2017/03/42522.html).
Don Boudreaux's own book blurb contribution: "Lotta Moberg here explains, with a rare combination of sophistication and clarity, the promises and pitfalls of Special Economic Zones. Packing impressive institutional and theoretical knowledge into each page, this study is by far the best single analysis that I’ve read on SEZs. It should – it will – become an instant classic on the subject."
