I converse with author, aquapreneur, and President of the Seasteading Institute Joe Quirk. Download the podcast [here](https://www.seasteading.org/podcast-lotta-moberg-the-political-economy-of-special-economic-zones/).
His comment to the podcast: *"I wouldn’t understand the power of seasteading if I didn’t understand the power of Special Economic Zones. What are those? Let’s ask the expert."*
